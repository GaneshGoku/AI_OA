## Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring
ðŸ”· Predicting credit scores (0â€“1000) for wallets interacting with Aave V2, based solely on historical transaction behavior.


## Overview

This project develops a robust credit scoring system for DeFi users on the Aave V2 protocol (Polygon), assigning each wallet a score between 0 and 1000.
Higher scores indicate reliable, responsible usage patterns; lower scores reflect risky, exploitative, or bot-like behavior.
It is based solely on historical transaction data, without external KYC or reputation signals.
